/*To download rust, just go with installation process in the Book available on Rust offical website. You have to read atleat 
basic amount of information from the documentaion provided by any language officials as it is a good practice.*/

//Let's start with your first Rust code.

/*To create a rust file, if your using an IDE then create a folder with ".rs" extention. or using a text editor in terminal
create a new directory for this course and create a file with ".rs"*/

fn main() {
    println!("Angelina Jolie");
}

/*If you atleast don't know how to run a code, I would suggest him/her/them/F&%$$#% to stop coding.
If you are using anything like VScode or jetbrains etc. Just use RUN button. I myself using a text editor, a easy one which
is called nano, which is for "gays" ,but anyway in this i will teach you with nano.*/

/* To run in a compiler type "rustc main.rs" and then "rust main". Your code gets executed and and output is shown in below
line. By the way main is our file name.*/

/*What if after typing the first thing you got something down below it,"JUST GO AND DIE", type the code correctly which is 
shown you above. And the lines which come under them are called errors and let me tell you rust has the best error correcting
suggestion,unlike other languages where you can't get a clear cut view of your mistake.*/

/* Let's divide the structure of rust code. 
"fn main()" this defines a function called main, you can use any like" MY_A####"
but if your using 2 or more words use a '_' in between you should know this as to divide something in rust use that symbol.
The function body is in between "{}". It is a good practise to give the opening curly bracket in the same line with a one 
space between them. "fn main() { }". 
And the line "println!("A$$$$$$")" is our actual code. println! is a rust macro. We will dive into it deeper later but as of
now use a '!'. if you don't use the'ln' after 'print', it won't go to next line after excution. 
Don't ask me what is it (Idiots).
";" is used to end a line of code like in java.It just says that this line is over and next line is ready to begin.Most of
the lines in java end with ';'.
SO YOU DEFINE A FUNCTION WRITE A CODE INSIDE AND EXCUTED IT.*/

And forgot to mention I used comments to write the non code part as it is not executed we use 2 / if it a same line if it is
multiple lines we use a * and / you can see above and this is difference of writing something in code with comments and 
without comments but you should not write non code part withour comments like me.  

*Note pay attention on rust lang not on my english lang.
